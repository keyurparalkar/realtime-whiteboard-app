## Inspiration

This project was inspired from [Figma real time editing](https://www.figma.com/) and [miro's](https://miro.com/) white board functionality.

## Libraries

- FrontEnd

  - [React.js](https://react.dev/)
  - [Supabasejs](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/introduction)
  - [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics)
  - [nanoid](https://github.com/ai/nanoid)

- Backend
  - [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started)

## Approach

The project architecture is as follows:

- Whenever a new tab is opened with our project on our browser that means we need to create a new client instance of supabase. So we start by creating a client.
- Next, we create a channel so that the client gets added to that channel
- We listen for the `sync` and `leave` events of the Presence API
- On update of user activity we need to pass this data to all the other clients
- If the browser window is closed, we need to make sure that all the clients wonâ€™t contain data related to the removed client.

## Project Setup

- Backend:

  - Setup the Supabase CLI setup by following this [doc](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started).

- Frontend:
  - `yarn`
  - `yarn dev`
