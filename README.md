## Approach

project-arch-image

The project architecture is as follows:

- Whenever a new tab is opened with our project on our browser that means we need to create a new client instance of supabase. So we start by creating a client.
- Next, we create a channel so that the client gets added to that channel
- We listen for the `sync` and `leave` events of the Presence API
- On update of user activity we need to pass this data to all the other clients
- If the browser window is closed, we need to make sure that all the clients wonâ€™t contain data related to the removed client.
